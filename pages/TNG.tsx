                <div className = 'text-sm'>
                <p>You are always being watched. No, not by the person in the white van from across the street. Your phone, your computer, you TV, and even your fridge is watching you. They are observing you, analyzing you, understanding you. And they are doing a good job at it as well. The computers we surround ourselves with now know us better than we know ourselves! The amount of data collected, it all tells a story: the story of you. A prime example is Sahara Prime. In just twenty minutes, it knows your address, your name, what type of person you are, your interests, and so much more. Everything you do on the computer is being monitored and stored through data. There is so much data about you that if it were to go in to the wrong hands, the consequences would be insufferable. Your privacy is being taken away by these computers.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>What makes matters worse is that your personal computers aren't the only things that know who you are. The data being collected about you is being sold. Sold to companies who will do anything to promote their brand and find the perfect audience. Ever search for a product on Amazon and then find an ad for that exact product on your instagram feed? That is surveillance capitalism at its finest. Surveillance Capitalism is the economy which is centered around the transfer of data collected of you to corporations and businesses. It is how facebook and other companies make revenue. They sell you. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>And aren't you wondering why such companies would want information about who you would bring to disneyland from your family? These corporations have algorithms that can create inferences about you based on this data collected. These inferences indicate your moods and lead to the company having something called a behavioral surplus. Behavioral surplus, coined by Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff, is the surplus of data collected far exceeding the amount required to improve products and services. This additional data is used to train models that predict usersâ€™ behavior and represent their wants, values, interests, and more. With this behavioral surplus, you are the perfect victim for these corporations to release their advertisements, waiting for you to bite. And whether or not you bite is also stored as data and is sold to get a better idea of what type of advertisement and product works on you.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>These ads have the ability to impact you for the worse. You may think that ads are simply trying to help you find the perfect purchase, but there is so much more than that. Take politics for example. Recent trends indicate a more polarizing America, and one cause of that has to be social media. With the data about your political preference, your feed will only have stories and articles with your political preference since you have a higher tendency to open those. The more articles you open, the indications point to the more radical your views get. The rabbit hole just continues going down.</p>

                <h1 className = 'text-2xl'>Attention Economy</h1>
                <div className = 'text-sm'>
                    <p>Nowadays, our world revolves around our phone. Our interests, Our friends, Who we see ourselves, is all attatched to that small device in your hands. That is the way social media creators want it. Their entire purpose is to see how much of your life you can give to them. They create these algorithms and these features to get you hooked, addicted onto your phone. Features like push notifications, beautfiul animations and designs, like buttons, infinite scrolls, and much more are all just pieces in a chess game to capture its king: you. Studies show that the brain of someone addicted to their phone is very much similar to the brain of someone who has a drug or gambling problem. This constant barrage of shallow rewards rewires your brain to want more likes, retweets, and emoji reactions, which leads to social media addiction. It is a never ending cycle, pulling you in for more and more screen time. Why would they do this? The more time you spend on your phone, the more data they collect from you. The more data that they collect about you, the more companies are willing to spend for that data. Also, the more time you spend on your phone, the more ads you will be exposed to.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>The attention economy has negative effects for the user. Once addicted, the less focus and attention they will pay on particular things. They will be less productive and lazy. Studies show that those addicted to social media perform worse on cogitive tests which test the ability to multitask and be attentive. This particularly impacts students. By spending time on social media, they are spending less time on homework or having a social life. Thus, either their grades drop, or they rush to finish their homework at the last possible second, evoking feelings of stress. On top of that, lack of focus and attentiveness can have a terrible impact on a student's learning ability. </p>
